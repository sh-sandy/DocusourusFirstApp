# Client Certificate Authentication

The FundingShield WAVS API requires client certificate authentication for added security.

1. Obtain your client certificate from the API provider.
2. Configure the certificate on your client-side application.
3. Ensure that the certificate password is securely stored.

This ensures a secure and authenticated communication channel with the API.
